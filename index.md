title: An introduction to programming for research using python
---

In this course, we will introduce programming for researchers who handle data.

This is **not** an advanced course.

The fundamental ideas of programming will be introduced for the first time.

If you're already comfortable, with variables, loops, and functions, this course is not for you!
You should join us instead for [MPHYG001: Research Software Engineering with Python](http://development.rc.ucl.ac.uk/training/engineering)
