title: The Flipped Classroom
---

This course takes a "flipped classroom" approach to teaching.

Lectures as Broadcast
---------------------

In the olden days, before the internet, lectures were a "broadcast" medium: a way of getting
information from the lecturer's notebook into students' notebooks.

Work inside the classroom was used for sharing theory, and homework outside the classroom was used for exercises.

Lectures as forum
-----------------

In a world with an internet, this makes less sense.

We can provide online notes to cover the materials you need to know, and you can study these in your own time.

Class time can then be used as a forum, to discuss confusing aspects of the materials, work on exercises
with help from experienced teachers.

Learning with the Web
---------------------

Lecture notes have been treated as a standalone textbook, assuming students need to be able to learn
(and pass exams) without access to any other materials.

In a world with an internet, this is clearly wrong.

This course recognises that you *will* be googling for supplementary learning materials, and encourages that.
The problem is that the internet is full of materials of varying quality, and attempting to absorb it all
can leave learners even more confused.

Thus, good lecture notes should act as a scaffold or backbone to external materials: offering links to
the best of the web, and ordering and structuring these.
