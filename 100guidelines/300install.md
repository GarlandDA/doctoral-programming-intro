title: Installing Python on your own computer
short: Installation
---

If you can, we recommend using your own laptop to follow these notes, as the tools will
then be ready for use in your research.

You can follow the [IPython installation instructions](http://ipython.org/install.html).
Of the available options, we recommend the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution for beginners.

After completing the course, you may want to move to a manual installation via Python Pip.
