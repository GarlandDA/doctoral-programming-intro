The core of this course is a series of "IPython notebooks"
which cover the materials for the course.

These are supplemented by various additional online materials
which you should study in your own time.

Visit the links on the left to see a preview,
and follow the link in the notebook to download it and
work through it yourself.

IPython is available in UCL Cluster rooms, or you can follow
on your own computer by downloading [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
a bundle of Python, IPython, and several other useful packages
for research.
